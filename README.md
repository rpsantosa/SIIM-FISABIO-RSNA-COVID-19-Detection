Host Organizations
FISABIO, The Foundation for the Promotion of Health and Biomedical Research of Valencia Region

The Foundation for the Promotion of Health and Biomedical Research of Valencia Region, FISABIO, is a non-profit scientific and healthcare entity, whose primary purpose is to encourage, to promote and to develop scientific and technical health and biomedical research in Valencia Region. FISABIO integrates and manages the Health Research Map of the Centre for Public Health Research, Dr. Peset University Hospital Foundation, Alicante University General Hospital Foundation, Elche University General Hospital Foundation, and the Mediterranean Ophthalmological Foundation. The BIMCV facility is connected with a multi-level vendor neutral archive (VNA). The imaging population facility is storing data from the Valencia Region, which accounts for more than 5.1 million habitants.

Radiological Society of North America (RSNA)

The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) is a non-profit organization that represents 31 radiologic subspecialties from 145 countries around the world. RSNA promotes excellence in patient care and health care delivery through education, research and technological innovation.

RSNA provides high-quality educational resources, publishes five top peer-reviewed journals, hosts the world’s largest radiology conference and is dedicated to building the future of the profession through the RSNA Research & Education (R&E) Foundation, which has funded $66 million in grants since its inception. RSNA also supports and facilitates artificial intelligence (AI) research in medical imaging by sponsoring an ongoing series of AI challenge competitions.

In this competition, you’ll identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, you'll categorize the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19. You and your model will work with imaging data and annotations from a group of radiologists.

If successful, you'll help radiologists diagnose the millions of COVID-19 patients more confidently and quickly. This will also enable doctors to see the extent of the disease and help them make decisions regarding treatment. Depending upon severity, affected patients may need hospitalization, admission into an intensive care unit, or supportive therapies like mechanical ventilation. As a result of better diagnosis, more patients will quickly receive the best care for their condition, which could mitigate the most severe effects of the virus.
